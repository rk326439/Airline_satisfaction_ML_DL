## Airline Satisfaction Analysis
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of airline satisfaction using machine learning and deep learning algorithms. The analysis includes data preprocessing, model building, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation to predict and understand passenger satisfaction with airlines.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis comprises information about airline services, passenger demographics, and satisfaction ratings. The data includes features such as flight distance, inflight wifi service, departure/arrival time convenience, and more, as well as passenger satisfaction ratings. This dataset is valuable for understanding the factors that influence passenger satisfaction and for building predictive models to enhance airline services.

## Analysis Overview
The analysis in this repository is structured into the following key components:
Data Preprocessing: The initial step involves data cleaning, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. This ensures that the data is ready for modeling.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: EDA is performed to gain insights into the dataset, uncover patterns, and identify potential relationships between variables. Visualizations are used to better understand the data.

- **Machine Learning Models**: Various ML algorithms are applied to predict passenger satisfaction based on the dataset's features. These models include but are not limited to:

- Linear Regression
- K-nearest Neighbors
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

- **Deep Learning Models**: In addition to traditional ML models, deep learning models are employed to leverage the power of neural networks for more complex patterns and potential improvements in predictive performance.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: To optimize model performance, hyperparameter tuning techniques such as grid search and random search are employed. This helps identify the best hyperparameters for each model.

**Evaluation**: Model performance is assessed using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy,confusion matrix. The results are presented and compared to determine the most effective models.

# Conclusion 
The analysis concludes with a summary of findings and insights gained from the data.
